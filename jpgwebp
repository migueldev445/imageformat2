# Converting JPG Images to WebP

JPEG (JPG) has long been a popular image format due to its balance between quality and file size. However, with growing demands for faster web performance, WebP has become a preferred choice because of its superior compression and additional features.

## Why Convert JPG to WebP?

- WebP typically produces smaller file sizes than JPG, which helps improve website loading speed.  
- Faster page loads enhance user experience and search engine rankings.  
- WebP supports features that JPG does not, such as transparency and animation.

## When to Consider the Conversion

- When optimizing images for faster delivery on websites or apps.  
- For mobile-first designs where performance is critical.  
- If your audience primarily uses modern browsers that support WebP.
